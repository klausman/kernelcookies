kernelcookies - fortune datafile of kernel citations

NOTE: Some of the cookies may contain offensive language.
As I don't really want to decide on what someone might find
offensive or not and create two seperate files, I only
put this warning here. If you don't want offensive fortunes,
you'll have to weed this file out yourself.

This is Version 8 of the Kernel cookie file. It contains some of 
the more obscure kernel messages in the Linux Kernel. One of the 
most famous messages ("lp1 on fire") was part of the linuxcookies 
data file (and got me started on this compilation). 

Hunting these messages is a tedious task: There's little more
chance than issuing:
/usr/src/linux $ find . -name \*.[c|h]|xargs grep -i printk|more

("printk" may be replaced by "panic" or "penguins" or any other
word you're looking for)

Therefore, I am greatful if anyone submits further messages of said
kind (please include source file name and kernel version).

If you need to recreate the .dat file (it's the index), you can
use strfile(1) which is included in the fortune distribution.

Have fun with the file,
Tobias
