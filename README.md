kernelcookies - fortune datafile of kernel citations

**NOTE:** Some of the cookies may contain offensive language in the sense of
curse words (not slurs!). As I don't really want to decide on what someone might
find offensive or not and create two separate files, I only put this warning
here. If you don't want offensive fortunes, you'll have to weed this file out
yourself.

This is Version 9 of the Kernel cookie file. It contains some of the more
obscure kernel messages in the Linux Kernel. One of the most famous messages
("lp1 on fire") was part of the linuxcookies data file (and got me started on
this compilation). 

I am grateful if anyone submits further messages of said kind (please include
source file name and kernel version).

To (re)create the .dat file (it's the index table), you can use strfile(1)
which is included in the fortune distribution.

Have fun with the file,
Tobias
